"""MI300X (gfx942 / CDNA3) GEMM -- the `tlx.ops.mm` implementation.

Promoted from `tutorials/amd_gemm_gfx942.py`, which is now frozen. The kernel
below is that file's kernel verbatim; what is new here is the search-space
plumbing every op needs -- lazy `_tuned`, a `heuristic_config` so a first call
does not autotune, and a `smoke` space.

The operand path is register-staged, which is what separates CDNA3 from the
gfx950 kernels next door:

    global --tl.load--> VGPR --tlx.local_store--> LDS --tlx.local_load--> MFMA

Three things the kernel does, and why:

* **Sized to the 64 KB CDNA3 LDS budget**, not CDNA4's 160 KB. The gfx950
  kernels' 256x256x64 two-buffer ring wants ~128 KB and cannot be made to fit.
  `_prune_configs` drops anything over budget before it is compiled.
* **Program ids remapped across the 8 XCDs.** Measured *neutral* here -- 0.86x
  aten with the remap vs 0.87x without at 4096^3, inside the noise -- because
  the GROUP_M swizzle already captures that reuse. Kept as the standard MI300X
  grid transform; set `NUM_XCDS=1` to A/B it.
* **`matrix_instr_nonkdim=16`** -- gfx942 fp16 MFMA is 16x16x16 / 32x32x8, half
  the K of CDNA4's 16x16x32 / 32x32x16.

Unlike sm100, this op has no TMA, so it reads operands through plain strided
pointers and imposes no alignment constraint. That is why it admits the odd-K
production shape that sm100 declines.
